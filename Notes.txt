Okay, I need to create a basic university newsletter website with a homepage and up to 3 content pages. The website should include a form, meta tags, tables, an animated image, email and external hyperlinks, a consistent banner/logo, consistent navigation, and an external stylesheet.

Here's the plan:

1. __Create a project directory:__ Create a directory to house all the website files.
2. __Create the homepage (index.html):__ This will be the main landing page.
3. __Create the content pages:__ Create up to 3 content pages with the required elements (form, table, animated image, hyperlinks).
4. __Create the external stylesheet (style.css):__ This will handle the overall styling of the website.
5. __Implement consistent banner/logo and navigation:__ Add these elements to each page for consistency.
6. __Add meta tags:__ Add appropriate meta tags to each page.
7. __Test the website:__ Open the `index.html` file in a browser to test the website.
