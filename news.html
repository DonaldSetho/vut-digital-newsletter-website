                <p>There is something electrifying about young people who refuse to let circumstance define their limits. Mr Prince Mashamba, a first-year Diploma in Fashion student at the Vaal University of Technology (VUT), is a shining example of this spirit, as he is lively, passionate and determined to make his mark far beyond lecture rooms.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in the humble township of Namakgale in Phalaborwa, Limpopo, Mr Mashamba arrived at VUT with more than just a suitcase. He brought ambition, creativity, and a hunger for opportunity. The leap from rural roots to the vibrant and bustling world of university life could have been overwhelming, but instead, it became a launchpad for him. He wasted no time stepping out of his comfort zone and quickly immersed himself in campus life by joining the VUT Fashion Police Structure under Student Life and Governance (SLG).</p>
                <p>However, Mr Mashamba’s journey did not stop at participation. He soared. His infectious enthusiasm and passion for fashion caught the eye of the Fashion Police chairperson, who selected him to represent the Department of Visual Art and Design at the Fashion Without Borders Show 2025, held at Hotel Sky in Sandton on 12 April 2025. VUT’s creative talent graced this renowned runway for the first time, and Mr Mashamba was at the heart of it.</p>
                <p>He reflected, “The fashion show is one of my best highlights so far as a first-year student and a first-time participant. It was a dream come true, as I have always wished to showcase my garments to people who love fashion, network with other designers from both local and international backgrounds, and possibly exchange ideas on how to craft garments and build a successful brand.”</p>
                <p>His story is a testament to the power of focus and faith. Mr Mashamba believes that dreams are within reach when determination lights the path. He quickly credited VUT’s supportive environment, particularly the SLG, for helping bridge the gap between students and their aspirations. “Put God first in everything you do and never underestimate your work,” he said, “because you never know who is watching and waiting to give you a lifetime opportunity.”</p>
                <p>The excitement is shared across the VUT community. The Fashion Police chairperson, Ms Surprise Thabethe, expressed pride in seeing VUT students selected as runway models and gratitude for the collaboration among students from fashion, photography, fine arts, and Student Support Services (SSS).</p>
                <p>Fashion Without Borders is more than just a show. It is a celebration of creative energy, a platform for emerging designers, and a reflection of the ever-evolving world of fashion. Recognition is due to structures like SLG, where VUT students not only earn qualifications but also seize real-world opportunities to shine.</p>

                <p> On 7 May 2025, the Human Resources Department at the Vaal University of Technology (VUT), in collaboration with 4D Healthcare Consulting (Pty) Ltd, hosted Wellness Day 2025, an event aimed at enhancing staff awareness of health and wellbeing.</p>
                <p>The day commenced with an energising fun walk led by Mr. Sakhile Cele (Director of HR Operations), Ms. Tshimangadzo Tambani (Remuneration and Benefits Manager), and the HR team. Starting at the university’s main gate and winding through the campus to the Desmond Tutu Building, symbolising a step towards healthier living.</p>
                <p>The central feature was the Wellness Experience, where staff underwent comprehensive health screenings lasting 20 to 30 minutes, receiving personalised wellness reports to inform them about their health status and lifestyle risks. Mr. Cele and Ms. Tambani led by example, being the first to participate in the screenings, reinforcing VUT’s commitment to employee wellness.</p>
                <p>In partnership with 4D Healthcare Consulting, the university provided expert-guided screenings, including Glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure tests (assessing cardiovascular and metabolic health), Weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI) measurements (evaluating physical health and obesity risk), Confidential HIV testing (ensuring privacy and discretion). Staff were encouraged to dress comfortably for assessments and bring their medical aid membership cards or driver’s licenses for registration.</p>
                <p>Wellness Day 2025 highlighted the importance of regular health checks and reminded everyone that wellness is a journey: one step, one screening, and one choice at a time. This initiative reflects VUT’s ongoing dedication to fostering a supportive, health-conscious workplace. By prioritising early detection and informed health decisions, the university empowers its staff to lead healthier, more productive lives.  These screenings are critical as they help individuals understand potential health risks early and take the necessary steps to address them. VUT fosters a workplace culture rooted in care, awareness, and proactive health management by investing in staff well-being.</p>
                <p>This initiative builds on previous wellness programmes at VUT, reinforcing the institution’s vision of a thriving, health-aware community.</p>
